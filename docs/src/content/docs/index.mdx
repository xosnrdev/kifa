  <Card title="Crash-Proof">
    Configurable fsync modes with dual-CRC validation. Direct I/O on Linux
    bypasses the page cache for true durability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Single Binary">
    No SQLite. No external database. No runtime dependencies. One static binary
    that does one thing well.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configurable Durability">
    Three flush modes: Normal for throughput, Cautious for zero data loss,
    Emergency for imminent power failure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for the Edge">

    power with limited resources.
